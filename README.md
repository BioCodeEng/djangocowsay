Important: I DO NOT give permission for anyone to clone this, with the exception of Kenzie staff who are grading it. If you are not grading it, don't clone it.
Also important: Part of Academic Integrity is definitely not plagiarising, but it also involves not interfering with, sabotaging, or obstructing another student's work. 

Edit: Monday, August 24, 2020: After having this public only 5ish hours, there are already 5 Clones with 5 Unique cloners. I refer to the above paragraph about cloning unauthorized unless you are authorized Kenzie Grading Staff, and the above-mentioned policy against against not only plagiarism but interfering with, sabotgaing, or obstructing another student's work, something I've had to deal with since Q1.
